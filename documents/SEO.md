SEO or "search engine optimization" is the process of improving your website's search enging ranking. It's how you get websites such as google to rank your website higher than others. SEO looks for importance in tags, for example; SEO looks for information inside of the h1 tag before the h2 or h3 tags, as h1 will usually contain the more important information. One thing you should not do, is add ghost pages or hidden text to your site in order to improve your SEO. This may confuse the crawler and effect your site's SEO points in a negative way.

If you coded everything correctly and have a high SEO score, your site will recieve a lot of free (organic) traffic, versus paid ads. Meta tags provide information about the webpage in the HTML of the document. Metadata isn't displayed on the website but it can still be read by search engines. By targeting and using the right keywords, we help search engines figure out what our content is about and who it might be for.
